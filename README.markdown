# Net::IRC

A ruby implementation of the IRC client protocol.

## Installation

Run the following if you haven't already:

    $ gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
  
Install the gem(s):

    $ sudo gem install -r sbfaulkner-net-irc

## Example

The gem installs the nicl command-line client (pronounced "nickle", as in worth
about a...). This client is strictly intended as a sample usage of and testbed
for Net::IRC, and is not meant as an example of how to write a command-line
client.
